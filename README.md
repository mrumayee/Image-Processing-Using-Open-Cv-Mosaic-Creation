# Mosaic Creation 
Introduction:
The Photo-Mosaic converts your favourite photos into an artistic mosaic of random shapes. 
It gives users the liberty to choose the number of pieces used to create the mosaic making it more user friendly and on the other hand the
auto-mode is a hassle-free experience, which creates the mosaic using random pieces. It also allows the user to choose between a number of styles of filters making the image even more artistic and fun and the user can then savethe image to his device in a desired space and a desired format. It not only allows the user to choose from the library of photos but also allows the user to take photos from the camera and directly convert it into a mosaic within the application. This makes the application user friendly and easy to use providing an artistic mosaic in a few moments.
